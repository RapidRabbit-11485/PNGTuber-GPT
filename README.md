# 🧠 PNGTuber-GPT 2.0 — Multi-Character AI Personalities for Streamers

## 🌈 Multi-Character Engine

### 🧍‍♂️ Run up to 5 Personalities at Once
- **True multi-character support:** manage up to five distinct PNG or AI characters simultaneously.  
- Mix personalities — a shy fox, a grumpy dragon, a baby bot, a pirate bard — all chatting in real time.  
- Or stack *modes* for one character: fact-based, emotional, flirty, or chaotic, switching instantly via chat commands or redeems.

### 🧩 Redeem-Driven Modes
- Turn mood changes into Twitch redeems: “Furry Mode,” “Rage Mode,” “Pirate Speak,” “Hyper Zoomies.”  
- Seamlessly hot-swap contexts mid-stream without breaking memory or losing user data.

## 💬 Output Flexibility

### 🔊 Speak, Post, Both, or Headless
- **Speak:** Have the PNG character speak on your stream for TTS.
- **Post:** Have the bot interact in chat only, via commands.
- **Both:** Have the AI engage with chat via voice and text simultaneously. 
- **Headless Webhooks:** Send responses silently to overlays, Discord, or other bots for layered integrations.
