# 🧠 PNGTuber-GPT 2.0 — Multi-Character AI Personalities for Streamers

## 🌈 Multi-Character Engine

### 🧍‍♂️ Run up to 5 Personalities at Once
- **True multi-character support:** manage up to five distinct PNG or AI characters simultaneously.  
- Mix personalities — a shy fox, a grumpy dragon, a baby bot, a pirate bard — all chatting in real time.  
- Or stack *modes* for one character: fact-based, emotional, flirty, or chaotic, switching instantly via chat commands or redeems.

### 🧩 Redeem-Driven Modes
- Turn mood changes into Twitch redeems: “Furry Mode,” “Rage Mode,” “Pirate Speak,” “Hyper Zoomies.”  
- Seamlessly hot-swap contexts mid-stream without breaking memory or losing user data.

## 💬 Output Flexibility

### 🔊 Speak, Post, Both, or Headless
- **Speak:** Have the AI voice lines in real time for VTuber reactions.  
- **Post:** Text-only chat replies for subtle engagement.  
- **Both:** Talk *and* post simultaneously — perfect for highlight clips.  
- **Headless Webhooks:** Send responses silently to overlays, Discord, or other bots for layered integrations.

## 🧠 Core System Features

### 💾 Persistent Memory
- **LiteDB Engine:** Local storage for user profiles and knowledge — fast, private, portable.

### 🎭 Character Context System
- **Behavior Templates:** Each mode defines tone, attitude, and emotion — not raw data.  
- **Creator-Friendly:** Write new personalities in under 1,000 tokens using clear markdown structure.  
- **Pre-Built Modes:** Furry, Baby, Nerd, Oracle, Evil, Drunk, Gremlin, and more.

### 🗣️ Streamer.bot Native Integration
